# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project implements the classic two-player game Tic-Tac-Toe using Python. The game board is made of nine cells numbered from 1 to 9, which players mark alternately with an 'O' or an 'X'. The goal is to be the first to mark three 'O's or 'X's diagonally, horizontally, or vertically. The code base utilizes Python's object-oriented programming, defining a TicTacToe class with attributes and methods to represent the game's features. The Python random module is employed to randomly select the first player.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

* Python 3.x

## Usage
Running the tictactoe.py script in a Python environment will start the game. Players will be asked to input a number from 1 to 9 to mark a cell on the board, with '1' being the first cell and '9' being the last cell. Invalid inputs or attempts to mark already filled cells will prompt the game to request for input again.

Users will see the game board after every turn and be notified on the console screen if a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
